Milestone 3:

In this milestone, we focused on building the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application. The key objectives were to set up a server, connect it to a database, and establish a solid folder structure to keep our code organized.

Backend Folder Structure: We created a structured hierarchy for organizing backend code. This includes dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure will make it easier to scale the project as more features are added in future milestones.

Server Setup: We initialized a Node.js server using the Express framework. The server is now configured to handle API requests, and it listens on a designated port for incoming requests.

Database Connection: We integrated MongoDB into the project to store and manage data. The server is now connected to MongoDB, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

Error Handling: Basic error-handling mechanisms were added to ensure that the server can respond with clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

Milestone 4:

In Milestone 4, we focused on enhancing the backend by creating a User Model, setting up a User Controller, and enabling file uploads using Multer. These features are key to handling user data and media effectively in the e-commerce app.

User Model: We created a User Model, which defines how user data is stored in the database. This includes fields such as name, email, and password. We used MongoDB schemas to design the structure and validation rules for each user.

User Controller: The User Controller was developed to manage user-related requests, such as creating a new user and retrieving user information. This controller acts as the manager that handles data processing and communication between the frontend and the database.

File Uploads with Multer: We integrated Multer to enable file uploads, allowing users to upload images (e.g., profile pictures). Multer manages the file storage and ensures that the files are saved securely in the backend.

Milestone 5:

In Milestone 5, we focused on building the Sign-Up Page for the frontend, where users can register by entering their details. This page includes essential fields such as name, email, and password, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for registration.

Frontend UI Development: We designed the Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS. The page was structured to be intuitive, ensuring users can easily input their data to create an account.

Form Validation: Form validation was added to ensure that user inputs are accurate and meet the required format. For example, we validated the email format and enforced a minimum password length to enhance security. This step helps avoid errors and ensures only valid data is submitted to the backend.

UI/UX Enhancements: The design is simple yet effective, allowing users to smoothly enter their details. We focused on making the form clean and responsive, ensuring it works across devices.

Milestone 7: Login Endpoint üìù

Create a login endpoint to authenticate users. Users provide their email/username and password. The backend compares the entered password (hashed with bcrypt) to the stored password. If valid, a JWT token is generated and returned for subsequent requests.

Dependencies: bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken.

Test via POST /api/auth/login with email and password in the request body.

Response: Success with a token, or error for invalid credentials.

Milestone 8: Product Card Component üåü

In this milestone, we focus on creating a reusable product card component for your e-commerce app. The goal is to showcase product details (e.g., name, image, price) in a visually appealing way, making it easy for users to browse products.

Steps Completed:

1. Card Component: Designed a reusable card that accepts product details as props.

2. Homepage Layout: Implemented a grid/flexbox layout to display multiple cards neatly.

3. Dynamic Rendering: Used array mapping to dynamically render cards for each product.

Milestone 9: Product Input Form üåü

In this milestone, we focused on creating a frontend form for adding products to your e-commerce app. This form allows users to input detailed information about products, including multiple images, which will eventually be saved to a database and displayed on the product homepage.

Steps Completed:

1. Product Form: Built a form to input details like product name, description, price, category, and quantity.

2. Multiple Image Input: Added functionality for users to upload multiple images for each product.

3. Dynamic Data: Set up the form to eventually save the product data and display it dynamically on the product homepage.

Milestone 10: Product Schema & Endpoint Creation

In this milestone, I created a Mongoose schema to define the structure for storing product data in MongoDB. The schema includes fields like name, description, price, and image URL, with proper validation to ensure data integrity (e.g., required fields, correct data types).

I also built a POST endpoint that receives product details, validates the input data, and stores it in the database. This ensures that only valid product information is saved, maintaining a clean and reliable database.

Additionally, I explored optional features like creating admin roles for restricted access to product uploads. This milestone strengthens the backend process of handling product data, making it ready for display on the frontend in future milestones.
<hr>
Milestone 11 üåü

In this milestone, we learned how to display products dynamically on the home page using data stored in MongoDB. We built an endpoint to fetch all the products and a frontend function to display them using a product card component.
<hr>
Milestone 12 - My Products Page

In this milestone, we will build a "My Products" page that will display all the products added by a specific user. We will write an endpoint to filter products based on the user's email and send that data to the frontend. The data will be fetched dynamically and displayed using the Product Card component created earlier.
<hr>
Milestone 13 - Updating the product

This Express.js route updates a product in a MongoDB database, handling file uploads using multer. It validates input data, updates product details (name, description, category, tags, price, stock, email), and modifies images if new ones are uploaded. Errors are handled with appropriate status codes, ensuring robust error management and smooth database updates.
